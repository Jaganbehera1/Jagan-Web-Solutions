Place your background video file here and name it exactly `grenton.mp4`.

Requirements and recommendations:
- Path used by the app: `/videos/grenton.mp4`
- Use an MP4 encoded with H.264 for broad compatibility.
- Keep file size reasonable for web (e.g., 5-20MB) or provide a compressed / lower-res variant for mobile.
- If you want multiple resolutions, name them `grenton-720.mp4`, `grenton-480.mp4` and update `<video>` sources accordingly.

To use your file, copy the file from your local machine to this directory when deploying or during development.
